MOVIE TICKET BOOKING SYSTEM

BACKGROUND:
In the past, booking movie tickets has always been a task where people would have to wait in long queues. To overcome this issue, a ticket booking system was introduced. A ticket booking system is a Database Management System (DBMS) that stores customer and movie booking data. This system allows customers to book their ticket at their convenient theater, choose their seats, and on their preferred date to watch the movie. This project emphasizes a better customer experience by facilitating costefficient solutions, user-friendly options, easy and quick booking, and faster payout options, providing an overall hustle-free experience.

OBJECTIVES:
• Creating and storing account details of all users
• Centralized system that consists of all the movie theater screenings from which customers can book
tickets in a theater from list of many theaters in one place
• Providing data to determine the frequency to air shows depending upon how fast the past tickets get booked
• Providingdiscountstostudentaccountsandtopremiumcustomerstousetheplatformmorefrequently.
• Displaying seating (lower seats, middle seats, balcony, etc.) and pricing information of a particular
theatre.
• Notifying users of their booking two hours ahead of the movie.
• Handling customer complaints.
• Rating and review for the movie by each customer.
